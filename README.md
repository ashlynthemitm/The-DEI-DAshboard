# The-DEI-DAshboard

The DAshboard is a workplace gui to assist in measuring diversity, equity, & inclusion in the workplace. 
I created this project with Java Swing Components, JDBC, & MySQL. The interface contains several capabilities
such as personalized dashboards for administrators which allow them to create other admin accounts and input 
employee data. The interface also has personalized charts created to visualize the data of the workplace.
